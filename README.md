# God_s_Savior
First video game development. 

God's Savior is an action-adventure game heavily inspired by 2D Zelda games, set in a world inspired by ancient times and Greek mythology.

Our Godot-based project was developed over the course of a few months by a team of four individuals in a non-computer science university course aimed at exploring game development.

Launch the God's Savior executable, the game will start and you can have fun!
